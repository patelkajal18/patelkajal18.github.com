            <h2>project summary</h2>
            <p>> My final project will be replacing my mad libs project and be a collage generator where the user can create their own mad libs magazine and receive a randomized collage.</p>
            <h2>comparison project 1</h2>
            <p>> The Metropolitan Edge uses storytelling in their website. It begins with the user picking from simple items, maps. The simplicity of the choice really works to immerse the user in a story. The idea of starting with a simple element and then becoming more complex later on was unique. I also loved the color palette used.</p>
            <h2>comparison project 2</h2>
            <p>> Reut Chen’s portfolio beautifully displayed his work as a collage. The images are displayed as the same size and had a clean, minimal look to the layout. I loved that the images widened to the width of the screen so the square patterned mirrored a quilt.
            </p>
            <h2>project goals</h2>
            <p>> My projects hopes to combine the simple to complex storytelling of The Metropolitan Edge with the similar collage to Reut Chen’s portfolio. The Metropolitan Edge is more of a storytelling game whereas my project is a collage generator with storytelling aspects. The purpose of Reut Chen’s portfolio is to display his work whereas the purpose of my project to generate a collage for the user.</p>
            <h2>design strategies</h2>
            <p>> My design is going to be centered around building a collage from the small piece like paint color to the overall layout. The first screen will include an array of paints with artwork and the user can browse through them. The next screen will allow the user to add to the art by creating their own mad libs magazine. Finally, the last screen will be a collage of the original artwork and mad libs magazine. 
            </p>
            <h2>interaction strategies</h2>
            <p>> Users will be able to hover over each paint bottle and view different drawings I have created. A side overlay screen will appear showing the user the piece of art and a short description. Additionally, the mad libs form will include various inputs to fill out.
            </p>
            <h2>experience goals</h2>
            <p>> My goal is for users to easily look through art I have created in the first screen and then be excited to make their own in the second screen. Finally, I hope they are wowed by the resulting collage at the very end and it inspires them to create one in real life.
