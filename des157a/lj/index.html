                    <p>While scrolling through Awwwards.com, I stumbled across Marcus Eriksson’s website, https://themarcus.com/. 
                        His website is both visually appealing and interactive. The main page contains a horizontal auto scrolling 
                        gallery of his photography. Featuring overlapping photos of different sizes, this gallery has a sophisticated 
                        collage feel. Clicking on an image takes the user to a unique page about that project with more information 
                        and images. It is evident throughout the website that Marcus employs a strategic usage of contrast. The extensive 
                        use of contrasting colors is bold but balanced. Achieving this balance by pairing complimentary colors together, 
                        Marcus enhances the photography of each project. The changing of background colors as the user scrolls also hooks 
                        their attention. Ultimately, Marcus’s website takes the user through an unforgettable visual experience of 
                        his work. </p>

                    <p>In “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows”, Naema Baskanderi outlines that UI design at its core 
                        needs to be strategic in its purpose. For instance, modal windows only allow user interaction with itself 
                        by pushing the main window to the background. This would be useful when switching focus to a more important 
                        task, highlighting user input, or displaying information that’s not relevant to the general page. In other 
                        situations, overlay windows would hinder a user’s interaction with the page and frankly, confuse them. 
                        Thus, Naema suggests a standard layout to follow to maximize user interest. With a dark background shadow, 
                        title at the top center, button with clear labels, cancel option, and size less than 50% of the screen, 
                        your modal window will maximize user accessibility. </p>
                    <p>Ultimately, user interaction come down to familiarity with the product. By adhering to this standard 
                        layout and only utilizing modal windows in specific contexts, your window will enhance your website, 
                        not clutter it.</p>

                    <p>When designing a form, its usability should be the focus. Simple, straightforward forms maximize
                        user response and thus, are crucial for businesses. A key idea is to adopt the “less is more
                        theory”. In “Best Practices for Form Design”, Salim Ansari suggests that a simple layout,
                        minimal fields, or short sections aid the user in efficiently finishing a form. Further,
                        explaining different fields with optional tags, format examples, and top left labels improve
                        accuracy. </p>
                    <p>These suggestions are extremely useful when developing your own form. Prioritizing the user
                        experience allows designers to easily make choices about font, color, and layout. These tips
                        help to maintain a necessary balance between aesthetics and usability. A website form
                        exemplifying best practices is Google Forms. The layout is simple and easy to use with minimal
                        options to alter the overall look of the form. Allowing users to change colors or add a header
                        picture for the description incorporates design elements without compromising a form’s
                        integrity. Check out the website here: https://www.google.com/forms/</p>
